# DCIC-Fianl-Project
Radix-2 1024-points FFT and Radix-4 1024-points FFT implementation
## Radix-2 FFT
The system architecture is as follows:

*How to use?
  *Complie the main.m file in the and it will call the corresponding function
*Input data
  *The input data is a random sequence with length 1024
